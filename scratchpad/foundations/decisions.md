# Decisions: foundations

OPT-IN ledger for contested or multi-track work. Skip this file for simple,
single-track features. Before editing an entry, CLASSIFY the change and confirm
with the user: is this a **pivot** (supersede + re-open) or an **adjustment**
(new milestone)?

Statuses: `Open` · `Decided` · `Superseded` · `Deferred` · `Blocked`

Superseded entries are NEVER deleted — they keep a "Superseded by" link so the
trail of reasoning stays intact.

## D1 — Engine & platform strategy

- **Status:** Decided
- **Context:** First-time game developer, most comfortable on the web, but wants
  to keep the door open to ship on Steam and as a mobile app later.
- **Options considered:** Godot 4 / Unity / Web (TypeScript + Phaser 3) / Bevy (Rust)
- **Decision:** **Web-first — TypeScript + Phaser 3 + Vite.** Steam/desktop later
  via a Tauri or Electron wrapper; mobile later via Capacitor. These are additive
  wrappers around the same web build, not a port, so "web now" does not forfeit
  Steam/mobile.

## D2 — Core/render separation (the rule that makes D1 safe)

- **Status:** Decided
- **Context:** A web game can bleed engine/DOM assumptions into game logic, which
  is exactly what makes later platform moves a rewrite.
- **Options considered:** (a) Phaser-coupled game objects throughout /
  (b) pure-logic `core` package + thin `game` render layer + future platform shells
- **Decision:** **(b).** `core/` is plain TypeScript with no Phaser and no DOM —
  stats, grid, pathfinding, jobs, skills, turn rules, run state. `game/` renders
  it with Phaser. Benefits: the core is headlessly unit-testable (which is what
  the kit's "tests green" milestone gates check), and it travels unchanged into
  any platform shell.

## D3 — Phase pipeline: Meta → Deployment → Battle → Resolution

- **Status:** Decided
- **Context:** The signature non-combat jobs do NOT all act in the same place:
  Chef acts between battles (camp), Survivalist acts before a battle starts
  (deployment), Merchant acts in the economy/meta layer. Bolting these onto a
  single battle loop later would fight the architecture.
- **Options considered:** (a) one monolithic battle state / (b) explicit ordered
  phases with jobs/skills hooking specific phases
- **Decision:** **(b).** Model the game as ordered phases and treat jobs/skills as
  data that register effects into a phase. This makes the unique hook cheap to
  extend and is set up in M4, exercised in M5–M6.

## D4 — Field entities + a battle trigger/event bus

- **Status:** Decided
- **Context:** Traps (Survivalist), defensive nests (Builder), and ritual runes
  (Mage) look like three features but share one shape: a non-unit thing placed
  during Deployment that reacts to events during Battle. Modeling them separately
  would make each a bolt-on.
- **Options considered:** (a) hard-code each placeable as its own special case in
  the battle loop / (b) one **field-entity** abstraction (position, owner, state,
  trigger policy, effect) whose instances are **listeners on a battle
  trigger/event bus** (`onUnitEnterTile`, `onTurnStart`, `onUnitDamaged`, …).
- **Decision:** **(b).** Trap = one-shot listener; nest = passive aura/terrain
  modifier; rune = pre-paid charge (auto or manual trigger). Crucially, **M3
  builds the trigger bus + field-entity registry before any entity exists**, so
  later placeables are data + a listener, not new systems. Full spec:
  [`docs/design/systems/field-entities.md`](../../docs/design/systems/field-entities.md).

## D5 — Combat action economy: FFT-style CT clock + charged abilities

- **Status:** Decided
- **Context:** The signature prep mechanics (especially auto/manual-triggered
  runes) want a notion of effects committed in advance and resolving later. The
  action economy must accommodate that.
- **Options considered:** (a) Fire-Emblem-style one move + one action per discrete
  round / (b) FFT-style **continuous Charge-Time (CT) clock** (per-unit CT rises by
  Speed each tick; turn at CT≥100; Move + Act) **with charged abilities** that
  schedule on the timeline and resolve later.
- **Decision:** **(b).** Speed governs turn frequency *and* charge-landing speed.
  Ritual runes are modeled as **pre-paid charged abilities** placed in Deployment.
  Each side starts Battle with a **CT seed** from its deployed, non-captured units'
  Speed. **Accepted cost:** AI on a continuous clock is meaningfully harder than
  round-based — opted in with eyes open. Spec:
  [`docs/design/systems/action-economy.md`](../../docs/design/systems/action-economy.md).

## D6 — Two-tier prep; logistics as a first-class pillar

- **Status:** Decided
- **Context:** Prep splits cleanly into off-map resource management (buy gear, load
  ammo/materials, cook) and on-map placement. The player wants logistics to be a
  *headline pillar* aimed at crunch players, not garnish.
- **Options considered:** (a) a single lumped "setup" step / (b) **two tiers**:
  **Meta/Pre-deployment** (off-map resource logistics) feeds **Deployment** (on-map
  spatial logistics), linked by a **provisioning constraint** (you can only place
  what you carried; you can only carry what storage allows).
- **Decision:** **(b), with logistics elevated to a pillar.** Storage (Merchant) is
  the master cap; materials/ammo/rations are consumed in Battle and recovered in
  Resolution. This warrants a dedicated logistics milestone (an *adjustment*, not a
  pivot — north star unchanged). Spec:
  [`docs/design/systems/logistics.md`](../../docs/design/systems/logistics.md).

## D7 — Deployment as a per-unit push-your-luck time gamble

- **Status:** Decided
- **Context:** On-map setup should carry risk, not be pure upside, and the risk
  should reward fast/perceptive characters while punishing greed.
- **Options considered:** (a) a hard deployment-point budget / (b) a **soft**
  budget with a **transparent exposure model**: a safe allowance, then an
  **overdraw zone** with *shown, escalating* capture risk. **Awareness** governs
  safety (bigger safe allowance, less exposure per overdraw); **Speed** governs
  throughput. Overreach → the unit is **captured**: it starts Battle bound on the
  map (effective −1, removed from the initiative seed) but is a **rescuable**
  sub-objective; only a unit still captured at battle's end is lost (permadeath).
- **Decision:** **(b).** Transparent meter (no hidden roll), rescuable capture,
  Awareness=safety / Speed=throughput. Units may instead **hold position** (no
  prep, no risk, ready). Spec:
  [`docs/design/02-deployment.md`](../../docs/design/02-deployment.md).
